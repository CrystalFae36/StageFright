			<h3 class="text-heading-3">Who Are We?</h3>
			<p class="sample-text">
				We're Stage Fright, a punk rock band based in Columbus looking to change the world with the power of music! In our albums that walk the line between your typical hard rock and metalcore genres, we tackle the harsh realities of society through the lens of the monsters woven into folklore that hide in the dark.

			<h3 class="text-heading-2">How We Met</h3>
			<p class="sample-text">
				On a brisk Halloween morning back in 2021, the five gathered in Ace's apartment, character sheets and dice in hand, ready to embark on the adventure that would soon shape their futures. At the time, it was just a fun D&D one shot, written and dungeon-mastered by Ace, with the purpose of giving his friends something to do when their usual spooky plans were cancelled. During one of the many breaks in the campaign, Cora mentioned that she played bass guitar, and from there, the band was born! Each member's character became their stage personas, with Ace pulling a character from one of his previous homebrew campaigns. Taking it a step further, they created cosplays to match, donning them for performances and official band work.
